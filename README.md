# Technical Exercise | Javascript Calculator

## Project Outline
The following coding test involves 2 parts - 
1) The first part is to develop a small JavaScript library that performs some simple arithmetic operations. eg add, subtract, divide and multiply. 
2) The second part is to develop a UI for a calculator that should also use your calc utility.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine before installation of :

Install Git [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (latest version)  
Install Node.js [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  (latest version)
Install npm [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Installation 
Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/lukemico/javascriptcalculator.git

cd javascriptcalculator
```

then follow instructions in the Running section.

## Steps for running a local version
Run the following via the Command Line:

```
cd javascriptcalculator  ( to ensure you are in the correct folder ) 

run npm install

run npm start
```

You should now be directed to a locally hosted version of the Calculator exercise.
